# GrubDash Back End Application

## In this Thinkful Assignment  -  I completed the following task

In the src/dishes/dishes.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, and list dishes. Note that dishes cannot be deleted.

In the src/dishes/dishes.router.js file, add two routes: /dishes and /dishes/:dishId. Attach the handlers (create, read, update, and list) exported from src/dishes/dishes.controller.js.

In the src/orders/orders.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, delete, and list orders.

In the src/orders/orders.router.js file, add two routes: /orders and /orders/:orderId. Attach the handlers (create, read, update, delete, and list) exported from src/orders/orders.controller.js.

Anytime you need to assign a new id to an order or dish, use the nextId function exported from src/utils/nextId.js.
